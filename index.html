            We present the first method capable of photorealistically reconstructing a non-rigidly

          </p>
          Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success in various multi-modal tasks, but they are often bottlenecked by the limited context window and high computational cost of processing high-resolution image inputs and videos. 
          Vision compression can alleviate this problem by reducing the vision token count.
          Previous approaches compress vision tokens with external modules and force LLMs to understand the compressed ones, leading to visual information loss.
          However, the LLMs' understanding paradigm of vision tokens is not fully utilised in the compression learning process. -->
          <!-- We propose VoCo-LLaMA, the first approach to compress vision tokens using LLMs. 
          We strive to fully utilize the LLMs' understanding paradigm of vision tokens during the compression learning process.
          By introducing <b>V</b>isi<b>o</b>n <b>Co</b>mpression tokens during the vision instruction tuning phase and leveraging attention distillation, our method distill how LLMs comprehend vision tokens into their processing of VoCo tokens.
          VoCo-LLaMA facilitates effective vision compression and improves the computational efficiency during the inference stage.
          Specifically, our method achieves minimal performance loss with a compression ratio of <b>576 x</b>, resulting in up to 94.8% fewer FLOPs and 69.6% acceleration in inference time. 
          Furthermore, through continuous training using time-series compressed token sequences of video frames, VoCo-LLaMA demonstrates the ability to understand temporal correlations, outperforming previous methods on popular video question-answering benchmarks.
          Our approach presents a promising way to unlock the full potential of VLMs' contextual window, enabling more scalable multi-modal applications. -->
          Mapping air pollution at high spatial resolution is essential for understanding, managing, and mitigating the adverse impacts of air pollution. 
          The current approaches for air pollution monitoring (e.g., ground station, satellite) suffer from limited spatial coverage and resolution. 
          Artificial intelligence (AI) has shown great potential to resolve these issues. However, regarding low-quality labeled data and uneven spatial coverage, AI-based methods with transferability for air pollution monitoring are still in their infancy. 
          Here, we introduce an innovative 3D implicit representation, dubbed Height-Field Signed Distance Function (HF-SDF), to reconstruct air pollution concentration maps at spatial resolutions of desire, which can achieve both extensive spatial coverage and fine-scale results with powerful transferability. 
          Our proposed HF-SDF, which integrates a deep network with a geometric constraint, can produce adaptive high-resolution air pollution maps, which are robust to noisy and locally incomplete data.Our framework can learn a continuous, transferable 3D generative model of HF-SDF, 
          by employing an auto-decoder network structure, allowing for the comprehensive reconstruction of a broad spectrum of air pollutants. 
          The evaluation based on two types of air pollution data, including aerosol concentration maps and satellite observations, reaches accuracy rates of 96% and 91%, respectively. 
          HF-SDF reveals immense promise in advancing air pollution monitoring by offering insights into the spatial heterogeneity of pollution distributions.

           Details regarding the dataset used for model training and testing, as well as model performance, are summarized in Table 1. 
          The training set comprises PM2.5 data (TAP) collected from 2021 to 2022 in six locations: Chengdu (CD), Bazhou (BZ), Taiyuan (TY), Changsha (CS), Xining (XN), and Longnan (LN), each covering a geographic area of 10&deg; &times; 10&deg;. For additional details, refer to the Supporting Information (Table S7). To address concerns of homogeneity, the training dataset includes 1080 instances of concentration maps, randomly sampled from 180 days between 2021 and 2022 for each location. 
          Subsequently, test sets, which include different regions, times, and air pollutants, were utilized to assess the model's generalization capability and transferability.
